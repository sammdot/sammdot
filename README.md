# Sammi De Guzman 陳慧珊 :philippines: :hong_kong: :canada:

Hi! I'm Sammi (she/her), a software engineer at Twitter, and
currently based in San Francisco, California. I studied
Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca),
where I previously worked as a teaching assistant.

I like to cook, write code, design pretty websites, take transit, fly
virtual planes, and run around a deserted island in my spare time.
