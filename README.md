# Sammi De Guzman 陳慧珊 :philippines: :hong_kong: :canada:

Hi! I'm Sammi (she/her), a software engineer at Google, working on
internal infrastructure to support our Google Cloud Platform developers.

I am currently based in San Francisco, California, and (pre-COVID-19)
work out of the Google campus in Sunnyvale, California. I studied
Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca),
where I previously worked as a teaching assistant.

I like to cook, write code, design pretty websites, take transit, fly
virtual planes, and run around a deserted island in my spare time.
