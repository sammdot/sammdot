# Sammi De Guzman 陳慧珊 :philippines: :cn: :canada:

Hi! I'm Sammi (she/her), a software engineer at Google, working on
internal infrastructure to support our Google Cloud Platform developers.
I am also an alum of the [Engineering Residency](http://g.co/engresidency)
program, and have previously worked on the Google Play Developer API.

I am currently based in San Jos&eacute;, California, and (pre-COVID-19)
work out of the Google campus in Sunnyvale, CA, but I was originally
from Markham, ON and studied Computer Science at the
[University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), where I previously worked
as a teaching assistant.

I like to cook, write code, design pretty websites, take transit, fly
virtual planes, and run around a deserted island in my spare time.
